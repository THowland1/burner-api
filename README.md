# Burner API

This project started life as a clone of https://github.com/jamesqquick/Build-a-JAMstack-Course-Tracker-with-React-Serverless-and-Airtable

I intend on Ship of Theseus-ing it until its about BurnerAPI and no longer resembles the original project.
But darn this is a brilliant 2 hour head start
